- 👋 Hi, I’m @doeringi
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP) and IT-Security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about topics in Machine Learning - both about its application and vulnerabilities. Specifically, I've recently directed much of my attention towards prompt injection vulnerabilities in large language models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data, especially in Machine Learning and IT-Security.
