- 👋 Hi, I’m @doeringi
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine Learning, NLP and IT-Security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot about topics in Machine Learning - both its application and vulnerabilities. But just recently a big focus is on prompt injection vulnerabilities in large-language-models.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to data especially in Machine Learning and IT-Security.
